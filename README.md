# HR Analytics Dashboard: Employee Attrition & Workforce Insights

## Project Overview

This project is a complete end-to-end HR Analytics solution designed to analyze employee attrition and workforce trends using real-world HR data. The goal of this project is to simulate how companies use data analytics and business intelligence tools to monitor employee retention, identify attrition patterns, and support data-driven HR decision-making.

Employee attrition is a critical business problem because losing employees increases recruitment costs, reduces productivity, and impacts organizational performance. This dashboard helps HR teams understand which employees are leaving, why they might be leaving, and which factors influence attrition the most.

This project demonstrates industry-level skills in data analysis, business intelligence, and dashboard development using Power BI.
